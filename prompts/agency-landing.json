Include a 'Meet the Team' section with circular avatar placeholders, names, roles, and social media icon links. Add a client testimonials carousel with quote marks, client name, company, and navigation dots. Finish with a contact section featuring a sleek inquiry form (name, email, project type dropdown, message) and the agency's address and social links in the footer. Use bold typography contrasts, smooth scroll-triggered fade-in animations, and a sophisticated dark or neutral color palette with one vibrant accent color. Create a complete, self-contained HTML page with inline CSS and JavaScript."
