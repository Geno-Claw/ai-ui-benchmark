  "prompt": "Create a complete chat application interface with a two-panel layout. The left panel should show a conversations list with a search bar at the top, followed by conversation items displaying user avatars, names, the last message preview (truncated), timestamp, and an unread message count badge. Highlight the active conversation. Include 6-8 sample conversations with varied states (online, offline, typing). The right panel should show the active conversation with a header displaying the contact's name, online status dot, and call/video/info icon buttons. The message area should display a realistic conversation with 10+ messages using chat bubbles — sent messages aligned right (colored background), received messages aligned left (neutral background), with timestamps shown below each bubble. Include at least one image message placeholder and one link preview message. At the bottom, add a message composer bar with an emoji picker button (that opens a small emoji grid popup with common emojis), a file attachment button, the text input field, and a send button that animates on hover. Show a typing indicator animation (three bouncing dots) below the last received message. Add smooth scroll to the bottom for new messages and subtle message appear animations. Create a complete, self-contained HTML page with inline CSS and JavaScript."
