Use a clean, professional design with a cohesive color palette. Include smooth scroll behavior, hover effects on interactive elements, and ensure the page is fully responsive. The design should feel premium and trustworthy. Use only HTML, CSS (inline or in a style tag), and vanilla JavaScript. Do not use any external frameworks or libraries except Google Fonts."
